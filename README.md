# Welcome to my Storage Managers example
This repository contains a working TODO app. However, the app is supported in three different storage providers:
- [LocalStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)
- [SessionStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage?retiredLocale=nl)
- [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API?retiredLocale=nl)

When running this site, you can switch between the different providers using the navbar buttons.
